- Convnets

## Fighting overfitting

- regularization
  - L1/L2 regularization
  - dropout
- data augmentation
- use pretrained convnet
  - feature extraction from pretrained convnet with frozen converutional base 
  - fine-tuning pretrained convnet with a few top layers unfrozen in converutional base
